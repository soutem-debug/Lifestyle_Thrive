                <p>Spending time outdoors is great for our minds and body so it is no surprise that
                  gardening is the perfect pass-time to lift your spirits. When I was a child my
                  Grandad taught me how to garden, although looking back I was probably more of a
                  hindrance then help! Since I have grown up I now understand more what drew him to his garden.</p>
                <p>As well as keeping you actively fit the greatest benefit for me has  been developing a
                  growth mindset. With a growth mindset, I am aware that I am constantly learning.
                  When something doesn't work or the end product is not planned I would previously of
                  viewed that as a failure. After much trial and error between my garden and allotment
                  I now view it as an opportunity to learn, which is a thought process I apply to all
                  areas of my life.</p>
                <p>Donâ€™t have access to a garden?</p>

                <p>Build a Terranium</p>
                <p>Terraniums are miniature landscapes in a glass vessel, they let you exercise your
                  creativity, and planting one is a great activity to do at home, especially with
                  your kids.</p>

                <p>Grown chillies </p>
                <p>Chillies are a great way to liven up meal times and they are super easy to grow
                  as long as you have a bright and sunny windowsill. You can grow chillies from seed,
                  sowing in January-March, or you can buy established plants online.  </p>

                <p>Grow herbs</p>
                <p>Fresh herbs add depth and flavour to your dishes, and are easy and cheap to grow.
                  Annual herbs such as basil, coriander and parsley are easy to grow from seed,
                  thriving in a bright, sheltered spot such as a windowsill or window box.  </p>
