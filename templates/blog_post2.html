                <p>Bloggers top tips:</p>

                <p>Eel Pool Description: Correctly known as the Long Eel, this is a big pool on the
                    river Ribble just downstream from the popular Stainforth Foss and a regular
                    Dales Dippers haunt. A good 50 metres of swimmable distance and up to 4 metres
                    deep in places. Rocks at the side for changing and jumping/diving off. Access
                    not good for the mobility impaired (see notes below on slippery and steep access).

                <p>Janets Foss Description: - A delightful small pool in woodland near Malham, one
                    of the Dales Dipper’s favourites and used in winter for our floodlit swims.
                    VERY popular with visitors so does get extremely busy throughout the day and
                    early evening. Early morning is best to have a peaceful dip here. Parking and
                    directions: - Janets’ Foss is located at - https://w3w.co/tangible.snack.contained </p>
